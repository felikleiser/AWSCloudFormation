CloudFormation Demo
As a way of demonstrating your skill level with AWS and Infrastructure-as-Code in general (CloudFormation, Bash, and Git, in particular), please take the following actions:

Fork this repository and start a new branch in your copy.
In your new branch, add:
A CloudFormation template (written in YAML)
A bash script that will deploy your template (assume the environment is configured with credentials already)
Commit to your branch (you could use multiple commits as you progress) and push to your copy of this repository on GitHub.
Open a pull request from your repository to this one.
What should go in your CloudFormation template?
Your template should provision the following resources:

A KMS Key
A Secrets Manager Secret
With a dynamically generated secret (encrypted by the Key in #1)
An EC2 Instance
Use whatever AMI seems reasonable to you
Assume a VPC already exists and set the instance's subnet using a parameter
Supply a User Data script that reads the Secret value from #2 when the instance starts up and echos the Secret value to a file
An IAM Role and IAM Instance Profile
The Instance Profile should be by the EC2 Instance
Permissions granted to the Role should allow it access to read the Secret
A Security Group
This should be used by the EC2 Instance
It should allow limited inbound traffic
It should allow all outbound traffic
Assume a VPC already exists and the security group's vpc using a parameter
Add any other parameters or outputs that seem right to you. If this is too easy, enhance and make it your own- add tags, create a bucket and secure it, log the secret value to CloudWatch logs, the sky is the limit!
